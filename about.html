        <h2>Where We Started</h2>
        <h3>
          <br />
          CAÑON IT SOLUTION is a computer retail business founded on the values
          of convenience, accessibility, and excellent customer service. Believe
          it or not, this local technology retailer had pretty humble beginnings
          – when Cris Cañon the founder who were passionate about tech hunted
          down secondhand PCs online to resell at decent rates. CAÑON IT
          Solution officially got its name when opened our first store in
          Koronadal City in September 2021. Building a brand that promises
          reliable services and quality products. Eventually, we shifted to
          selling brand new products at accessible prices.
